This beautiful logo was composed by yours truly for a school project. A portmanteau of "electricity" and "arctic", our team found it to fit our little mobile app, with electricity representing the central theme of our assignment and the arctic representing the cold harshness of software development that we faced. Well, that or the location and main marketing gimmick of our physical area, that's left as an exercise to the reader. 

If you happen to recognize the name from somewhere, the project was shown off at the Lapland University of Applied Sciences ICT Expo 2023, so if you were a visitor at our booth, thank you for checking it out! It warmed our hearts to receive plenty of positive feedback, and it was a joy to meet you all!

For the rest, let me give you a quick rundown of the purpose of our little app:

With a quick glance of our app, the user receives useful information of their home's heating system, and in our specific case for a customer who has in addition to spot priced electric heating a wood-style heating possibility, if they should stock up on firewood to reduce their total electricity bill.
